**Bug Fixes**:
* Fixed Advancements being spammed to chat (Fabric)
* Fixed advancement chat config being ignored
* Fixed an issue where the bot would leave the server hanging on shutdown

**Changes**:
* Command relays now longer include the arguments of the command. Only the name of the command that was executed. This protects sensitive commands like /login

* Added a `link` feature to allow players to link their Minecraft and Discord accounts
* Added in-game/discord command for server staff to view linked accounts
