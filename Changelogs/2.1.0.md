### Notes:

The Console Channel and Linked commands are a BETA feature. If you only wish to use Console Commands, and not have the console relayed, you can disable it using the
`sendConsoleMessages` config option.


The formatting feature is also experimental. If it does cause problems for you, you can disable it using the `formatting` config option, BUT PLEASE REPORT ANY ISSUES!
