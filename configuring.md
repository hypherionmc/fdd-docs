!!! danger
Simple RPC now includes a basic in-game config screen, that is available when Cloth Config is installed. You can find the button at the TOP right corner of the OPTIONS screen. This config screen does not yet support Buttons, or Dimension Overrides. It's still suggested to use our [Config Editor App](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/). It includes Live preview and fetches the available images directly from discord!
!!!

||| Information
Simple RPC uses a universal TOML based config system, with a well named Layout and comments. You can use the same config file on Forge/Fabric, without having to redo it.

In addition to the basic Rich Presence options, the mod also includes features such as Server Side config Overrides, Defining a custom Rich Presence based on the server you're connected to as well as including a translated Rich Presence, based on the language of the player.

#### Finding your config files:

Before 3.1:
`config/simple-rpc.toml`

Version 3.1:
`simple-rpc/simple-rpc.toml`

Version 3.2+
`config/simple-rpc/simple-rpc.toml`

!!! danger
You do not need to restart the game while editing the config. The config will AUTO RELOAD when the file is saved
!!!

## Config Types

+++ Client Only Config
This is the default config that you will use.

This contains all the config for your rich presence such as your discord ID, assets and texts.

You can find this file at:

Before 3.1:
`config/simple-rpc.toml`

Version 3.1:
`simple-rpc/simple-rpc.toml`

Version 3.2+
`config/simple-rpc/simple-rpc.toml`

Below is a copy of the default, unconfigured config shipped with the mod.

+++ Translated Configs
Simple RPC allows for language detection in Minecraft, so If you decide you wanna play Minecraft in a different language, your discord status can now be shown in that language. But it requires some setup, which is why this section exists.

To make use of this feature, simply copy your default `simple-rpc.toml` file, using the naming example below.

!!!primary 
To find a complete list of lang-codes, check out this site -> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Languages.
!!!

Once you have created this file, you can change all "state", "description", "largeimagetext" and "smallimagetext" fields. You cannot translate the imagekeys!

Some name examples of languages:

    American English -> "simple-rpc-en_us.toml"
    Dutch -> "simple-rpc-nl_nl.toml"

!!!danger Warning: Leave the default config file in english, as the mod falls back to this file when a translated file cannot be found 
!!!

+++ Per Server Override
Since Simple RPC Version 2.5, it's now possible to add "custom server entries", that allow you to change the Rich Presence display data based on the IP of the server you are connected to. This allows modpack makers to include a rich presence when someone is playing on one of their official servers, instead of just having `Playing on djghksdjh`.

This file can be found in the `config/simple-rpc` folder and is called `server-entries.toml`. 

This file, like the normal config file also supports translations, so, you can for example use `server-entries-en_us.toml` for english.

This file has a very basic layout, and is easy to work with. By default, the config file looks like this:

```json
enabled = false
version = 2
entry = []
```

To add a custom server entry, simply replace `entry = []` with the following:

```json
[[entry]]
    ip = "yourserverip"
    description = "Look mom, I have a server!"
    state = "Playing on the best damn mc server ever"
    largeImageKey = ["server_log"]
    largeImageText = "Find us at https://myawesomeserver.com"
    smallImageKey = [""]
    smallImageText = ""
```

!!!info 
Please note that ip, has to match the IP address or url that you use to connect to the server exactly. Meaning if you connect using server.yourdomain.com, then you need to use that as the IP. If you use 127.0.0.1:5689, then you need to use that as the IP
!!!

As an example, a complete config file would look like this:

```json
enabled = true
version = 2

[[entry]]
    ip = "hypherionmc.me:3008"
    description = "Testing Server Overrides"
    state = "Playing on a local server"
    largeImageKey = ["hypherion_2"]
    largeImageText = "It works"
    smallImageKey = [""]
    smallImageText = ""
```

!!!warning 
Don't forget to change enabled to true to enable this config file to work!
!!!

+++ Per Biome RPC
Since Simple RPC 3.1, it's not possible to apply an RPC based on a Biome, Dimension or Both.

### Dimension Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a dimension or "world", simple enter the name as `modid:dimension`.

For example: `minecraft:overworld`

### Dimension Information Overrides

```json

[dimension_overrides]
#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "overworld"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "%player% is in The Overworld"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = ["overworld"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = ["mclogo"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```

### Biome Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a biome, simple enter the name as `biome:modid:dimension`.

For example: `biome:minecraft:plains`

NOTE: biome: is required, otherwise the mod will try to match a dimension

### Dimension Information Overrides
```json
[dimension_overrides]
#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "biome:plains"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "Player is feeling PLAIN"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = ["overworld"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = ["mclogo"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```

### Dimension & Biome Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a dimension & biome, simple enter the name as modid:dimension|modid:biome.

For example: `minecraft:overworld|minecraft:plains`

NOTE: | is required. This tells the mod to match both the Biome and Dimension

### Dimension Information Overrides

```json
[dimension_overrides]
#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "overwold|plains"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "Player is feeling PLAIN"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = ["overworld"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = ["mclogo"]
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```

## Configuration Variables

||| Information
Variables are pieces of text added to the config file that allows you to display data from the game on your status.

These variables can be used inside any `state`, `description`, `largeImageText`, `smallImageText` and inside buttons.

Some variables can also be used inside `largeImageKey` and `smallImageKey`. These are marked with [!badge IMAGE]
