||| Overview
Simple Discord RPC is a simple and easy to use mod that allows you to display what you are doing in Minecraft on your Discord Status. 

This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. 

This mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs.
